21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:45:36] yeah, it includes direction, but it is null or "" for the most part
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:45:41] only a few languages have had direction entered
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:45:52] l3thal: yes, just change to qq
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:45:54] q*
21:16 #alchemists: 9<@nightshade427> [12:46:21] So this is good drew! 
21:16 #alchemists: 9< l3thal> [12:46:24] thanks drew ;)
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:46:28] sure :)
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:46:50] should be deployed before long, I'll post in here when it's done
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:46:59] going to write a few tests and test it out a little more
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [12:47:05] but the basic cases are working now in my dev
21:16 #alchemists: 9< l3thal> [12:47:09] awesome, thanks drew
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [14:48:32] done: https://auth.sovee.com/languages.json?q=es
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [14:48:52] also, it turned out I needed to make a couple changes form earlier which caused es-es to only return the es region in the list
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [14:49:13] so if you specify a region, it will be the only region listed
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [16:01:14] emacs 24.4 released: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-10/msg00713.html
21:16 #alchemists: 9< drew> [16:02:37] is upgrading minor versions of emacs generally painless or painful?
21:16 #alchemists: 9< l3thal> [19:11:10] drew: it's not that painful. 
21:16 #dev: 9< boggs> [09:12:06] drew you were the one who gave the friday lunch talk with rack-mini-profiler gem in it right?
21:16 #dev: 9<@drew> [09:12:24] yeah
